### Rag flow


### Why Rag used in this project:
The goal of this project is to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses based on document content. RAG is a perfect fit because it enables:

1. **Ensuring Contextual Precision**: RAG retrieves specific document content, grounding responses within relevant text for accurate answers.
2. **Minimizing Errors**: Combines retrieval with generation to reduce irrelevant or fabricated information, enhancing answer reliability.
3. **Adapting Easily to New Data**: Allows seamless updates to the document store without retraining, supporting dynamic datasets.
4. **Providing a Streamlined User Experience**: it provides precise, real-time answers that align directly with user queries.
