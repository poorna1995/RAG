### why Rag used:
The RAG offers:
- **Adaptability**: Allows adding new documents without retraining the model, ideal for dynamic datasets.
- **Precision**: Combines retrieval and generation for answers grounded in document content.
- **Efficiency**: Uses a vector database for fast similarity-based search, enabling real-time, accurate responses.
